- Alexander Rau -

Project Guideline Requirements:

- Basic static site setup with index.html and styles.css

- Site must be responsive

- Create a repo on github :octocat: for your work with following naming construct: `[initials]-comp-challenge-[challenge number] (i.e. “bt-comp-challenge-1”)`

- Include a README with the repo that provides a brief overview of the project, and images of both the original comp and your version.

- Push your final work to `github pages`


Description and Notes:

Here I have generated a basic site that mocks the comp: a profile for me, offering links to new pages that would offer more information on myself, based off of the labels on the links 
(and buttons).  Currently, I only built out this main page, so the boxes on the page do not currently serve as links.  I chose a color palate that I liked, earthy shades of green, and making use of darker colors for a cooler feel to the site.  As for color importance, I followed the comp: I made the brighter items in the comp brighter items here and any colors that matched in the comp also match here.  I have made this responsive and kept the box sizes to match the comp.  As for images, I selected logos that apply to what they are describing, and I did choose ones that made me laugh, in context with the link, so the humor is intentional.  My image is a picture of a bunny going gorcery shopping, and I feel it keeps the same feel as the rest of the site (as well as color scheme.
